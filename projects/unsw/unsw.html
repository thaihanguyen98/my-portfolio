          <h1>UNSW Short Course Website Redesign</h1>
          <h2>
            Website design and Information Architecture focus for short course
          </h2>
          <p>
            I was assigned a project for the UNSW Short course to re-design a
            website that is accessible and easy for users who are looking for a
            course. We had two weeks to research, design, prototype and test a
            website for them.

        <h2>Project goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Redesign the current website to be an intuitive website and improve
            the user experience for the students who will be using the website.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rebuild information architecture by reflecting real students' use
            cases and up-to-date content to register for social events, check
            their timetable, engage with the student online and much more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Delivery of low and high-fidelity UX UI design for the development
            process.

        <h2>Research discoveries</h2>
        <h3>User surveys</h3>
        <p>
          We conducted interviews with 7 participants that involve card sorting,
          usability testing on the current website and understanding their
          thoughts, feelings and preferences when looking for a course. We find
          that:
        </p>
        <h3>Key findings and insights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The website is not user-friendly and accessible. There are no
            results after typing in the search box.
          </li>
          <li>Content is disorganised and overwhelming.</li>
          <li>Unclear navigation and information architecture.</li>
          <li>
            Reason for a career change: unfulfilled job; unhappiness and looking
            for an upskill.Research the course through Google, Linkedin and
            recommendation from peers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Limitation #1: Commitment and afraid that they will make the wrong
            decisions.
          </li>
          <li>Limitation #2: Course price can be expensive.</li>
