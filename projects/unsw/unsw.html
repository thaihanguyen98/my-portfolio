          <h3>
            Website design and Information Architecture focus for short course
          </h3>
          <p>
            I was assigned a project for the UNSW Short course to re-design a
            website that is accessible and easy for users who are looking for a
            course. We had two weeks to research, design, prototype and test a
            website for them.

        <h2>Project goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Redesign the current website to be an intuitive website and improve
            the user experience for the students who will be using the website.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rebuild information architecture by reflecting real students' use
            cases and up-to-date content to register for social events, check
            their timetable, engage with the student online and much more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Delivery of low and high-fidelity UX UI design for the development
            process.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Research discoveries</h2>
        <p>
          We conducted interviews with 7 participants that involve card sorting,
          usability testing on the current website and understanding their
          thoughts, feelings and preferences when looking for a course. We find
          that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The website is not user-friendly and accessible. There are no
            results after typing in the search box.
          </li>
          <li>Content is disorganised and overwhelming.</li>
          <li>Unclear navigation and information architecture.</li>
          <li>
            Reason for a career change: unfulfilled job; unhappiness and looking
            for an upskill.Research the course through Google, Linkedin and
            recommendation from peers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Limitation #1: Commitment and afraid that they will make the wrong
            decisions.
          </li>
          <li>Limitation #2: Course price can be expensive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Solution:</h2>
        <p>
          Using our research, we created a mentor journey map that illustrates
          how the majority of the users interviewed fell throughout the process.
          It thus reiterated how crucial it was to make this process more
          inclusive and engaging when signing up to become a mentor and
          maintaining the relationship with the mentee. This helped to highlight
          how there’s a lack of a social relationship between the mentor and the
          mentee…we need to figure it out how the mentor keeps up the right
          relationship with the mentee.
