            <h3>Enhancing Emotional Intelligence for Parents</h3>
            <p>
              ParentalEQ is a parenting content platform that is designed for
              parents to be more self-aware, confident and connected with their
              children. This platform involves modules, activities and other
              exercises to build a new sense of understanding between parents
              and children, improving their relationship.

              I was contracted as a UI designer to improve better user interface

        <div class="po-details goal">
          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>
            To design a user-friendly platform that supports parents in
            understanding and nurturing emotional intelligence within their
            families, providing tools for self-reflection and guided learning.

          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Parents often face challenges in promoting emotional intelligence
            due to a lack of accessible resources and tools that fit their busy
            schedules. Parental EQ aims to bridge this gap with a
            straightforward, supportive interface that helps parents on their
            journey to emotional growth and connection.

        <div class="po-details outcome">
          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>
            A polished, intuitive app that enables parents to explore emotional
            intelligence concepts in practical, interactive ways, fostering a
            positive impact on family relationships.
