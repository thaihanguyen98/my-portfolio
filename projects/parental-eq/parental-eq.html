            <p>
              ParentalEQ is a digital platform designed to help parents develop
              self-awareness, confidence, and deeper connections with their
              children. The platform offers structured modules, interactive

        <div class="po-details goal">
          <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Goal</h3>
          <p>
            To design an intuitive, user-friendly platform that equips parents
            with tools for self-reflection, guided learning, and emotional
            intelligence development within their families.

          <h3>âš¡ Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Many parents struggle to foster emotional intelligence due to
            limited access to practical resources that align with their busy
            lifestyles. ParentalEQ aims to bridge this gap with a clear,
            structured, and supportive digital experience.

        <div class="po-details outcome">
          <h3>âœ¨ Outcome</h3>
          <p>
            The result is a refined, intuitive platform that empowers parents to
            engage with emotional intelligence concepts in a practical and
            interactive way. Through thoughtful design and user-focused
            iterations, the platform provides an engaging, effective learning
            experience that fosters stronger family connections and emotional
            well-being.
