          <h2>Empowering DSG Youth through Online Mentorship</h2>
          <p>
            StartOut Australia is a Health Promotion Charity dedicated to
            supporting the mental well-being of young people of diverse sex,
            sexuality, or gender (DSG). Their online mentorship platform
            provides a safe, socially inclusive, and anonymous space where DSG
            youth can connect with mentors for guidance, support, and personal
            growth—regardless of their location.
            <br />
            This project aimed to enhance the mentor-mentee experience by
            designing solutions that help mentors foster deeper, more meaningful
            conversations and better support mentees in building resilience,
            self-acceptance, and a positive self-image. The project was
            conducted remotely over two weeks through intensive research,
            design, prototyping, and testing.

          <h2>🔍 Research & Key Findings</h2>
          <p>
            We conducted interviews with mentors via Zoom to gather insights on
            their challenges and experiences. Unfortunately, mentees remained
            anonymous, preventing direct interviews.

          <h3>Key Insights from Mentors</h3>
          <p>
            We conducted interviews with mentors via zoom meetings.
            Unfortunately, we are unable to interview the mentees because they
            are anonymous. We discovered that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              ❌ Lack of ongoing support – Many mentors felt underprepared after
              initial training.
            </li>
            <li>
              📉 Long waiting periods – There was a 3-month to 1-year gap
              between training and receiving their first mentee.
            </li>
            <li>
              📩 Missed opportunities – Mentors were not notified when a mentee
              reached out via the platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              🔄 Unstructured interactions – Mentors often felt the mentoring
              process lacked guidance and would prefer more structured tools.
            </li>
            <li>
              🚫 Communication barriers – If a mentee was hesitant to engage,
              mentors found it difficult to maintain the relationship.

          <p>
            Based on mentor feedback, I designed wireframes and prototypes
            incorporating features to improve mentor-mentee interactions:

        <h2>✨ Results & Reflections</h2>
        <h3>🚀 Impact</h3>
        <p>
          The redesigned platform empowers mentors with the tools they need to
          provide meaningful, structured guidance to DSG youth. Feedback
          indicated that:
        </p>
        <p>
          ✅ Mentors felt more confident and prepared to guide mentees. <br />✅
          Mentees found it easier to open up, making conversations more
          impactful.<br />
          ✅ A stronger mentor-mentee bond was fostered through structured tools
          and better engagement.

        <h3>🎭 What I Learned</h3>
        <p>
          This project emphasized the importance of empathy-driven design,
          especially when working with vulnerable communities. The mentor’s
          experience played a key role in shaping our solutions, but I also
          realized how crucial it is to integrate mentee feedback for future
          iterations.
        </p>

        <h3>🔮 Project Takeaways & Future Directions</h3>
        <p>
          This project reflects my commitment to inclusive, human-centered
          design that prioritizes user well-being and accessibility. While this
          phase focused on mentor experience, I recognize the need for direct
          mentee feedback to refine the platform further. In future iterations,
          I would:
          <br />
          🔹 Conduct research with mentees (if privacy allows) to ensure their
          needs are fully addressed.<br />
          🔹 Further explore AI-driven engagement tools to provide dynamic,
          tailored mentoring support.<br />
          🔹 Enhance the mentorship dashboard with more real-time progress
          tracking and feedback mechanisms.
