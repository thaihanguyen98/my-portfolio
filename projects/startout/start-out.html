          <h1>StartOut Australia</h1>
          <h3>Design of Mentoring service service platform for LBGTIQ+</h3>
          <p>
            StartOut Australia is a Health Promotion Charity focused on reducing
            the burden of poor mental health for young people of diverse sex,
            sexuality or gender (DSG). It has an online mentoring platform to
            help anonymously mentor people, providing a safe, socially inclusive
            and welcoming space to engage and support the well-being of young
            DSG regardless of location.Our mission is to improve a better
            experience for the mentors can increase the level and depth of the
            conversation online and build self-acceptance of their sexuality in
            an online mentoring platform. We had two weeks to research, design,
            prototype and test a product for them. This project has also been
            done remotely.

        <h2>Project goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase engagement between the mentor and the mentee.</li>
          <li>
            Increase the level and depth of the conversation between both
            parties.
          </li>
          <li>Increase the length and quality of mentoring relationship.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Research discoveries</h2>
        <p>
          We conducted interviews with mentors via zoom meetings. Unfortunately,
          we are unable to interview the mentees because they are anonymous. We
          discovered that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lack of ongoing training and support.</li>
          <li>
            The gap between training and when mentors get their first mentee is
            enormous (3 months to 1 year)
          </li>
          <li>
            Mentors aren't notified via the online platform when a mentee has
            reached out to them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mentors may find the current mentoring process a little ambiguous.
            They would prefer a little more structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the mentee cannot or does not want to talk, it can be hard to
            maintain the relationship.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Solution:</h2>
        <p>
          We proposed a mobile application with a web chat for communication
          with the mentees and also you can communicate with other mentors for
          practice chat and advice. The mobile application also includes short
          courses, journal entries and an "End chat" button if the mentee is no
          longer communicating with the mentor. We designed, tested and
          delivered a mobile prototype in addition to a content strategy
          document upon completion of the project. The project was presented to
          the clients and other stakeholders in a half-hour presentation.
