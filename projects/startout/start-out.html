          <h2>Empowering DSG Youth through Online Mentorship</h2>
          <p>
            StartOut Australia is a Health Promotion Charity focused on reducing
            the burden of poor mental health for young people of diverse sex,
            sexuality or gender (DSG). It has an online mentoring platform to
            help anonymously mentor people, providing a safe, socially inclusive
            and welcoming space to engage and support the well-being of young
            DSG regardless of location.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our mission is to enhance the online mentoring platform experience,
            supporting mentors in fostering deep, meaningful conversations with
            young people of diverse sex, sexuality, or gender (DSG). The
            platform aims to help mentees build resilience, self-acceptance, and
            a positive self-image. We had two weeks to research, design,
            prototype and test a product for them. This project has also been
            done remotely.

          <h3>User surveys</h3>
          <p>
            We conducted interviews with mentors via zoom meetings.
            Unfortunately, we are unable to interview the mentees because they
            are anonymous. We discovered that:

          <h3>Key findings and insights</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Lack of ongoing training and support.</li>
            <li>
              The gap between training and when mentors get their first mentee
              is enormous (3 months to 1 year)
            </li>
            <li>
              Mentors aren't notified via the online platform when a mentee has
              reached out to them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mentors may find the current mentoring process a little ambiguous.
              They would prefer a little more structure.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the mentee cannot or does not want to talk, it can be hard to
              maintain the relationship.

          <h2>Ideation & Wireframes</h2>
          <p>
            Based on user needs and journey mapping, I crafted wireframes with
            the following features:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Session Prep Toolkit: </strong>A resource hub that
              provides conversation starters, topic guides, and training
              refreshers to mentors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mentee Progress Tracker:</strong>Visual indicators that
              allow mentors to follow mentee growth, showing achievements or
              moments of self-acceptance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reflective Journaling: </strong>A feature that lets
              mentors take notes and record conversation highlights, fostering
              continuity in future interactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>End chat button</strong>The mentee can click the button
              when they are no longer communicating with the mentor.

        <h2>Testing & Iteration</h2>
        <h3>Usuability highlights:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Postive feedback: </strong>Mentors appreciated the Session
            Prep toolkit and noted that it helped them feel more equipped to
            start difficult conversations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Iteration Based on Feedback: </strong>Based on feedback, we
            streamlined access to resources within sessions, ensuring mentors
            could reference the toolkit without interrupting the flow of
            conversation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Key improvement:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Interactive Conversation Tools: </strong>Introducing
            conversation prompts, guided questions, or visual mood check-ins
            could help mentors and mentees connect more deeply. These tools
            could support mentors in initiating and sustaining meaningful
            discussions, even around sensitive topics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Resource Hub for Mentors: </strong>Having an accessible
            library with resources, training refreshers, and content on specific
            challenges DSG youth may face would equip mentors with the knowledge
            to handle complex situations confidently and empathetically.

        <h2>Results and Reflections</h2>
        <h3>Impact:</h3>
        <p>
          The redesigned platform enables mentors to foster deeper, more
          impactful conversations, helping DSG youth feel seen and supported.
          Both mentors and mentees reported feeling more connected, with mentees
          noting that the new tools made it easier to open up.
        </p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          This project highlighted the importance of designing with empathy,
          especially for vulnerable groups. Working closely with mentors and
          StartOut team helped me understand how small design decisions can have
          a profound effect on user confidence and comfort.
        </p>

        <h3>Project takeways</h3>
        <p>
          The "StartOut" project illustrates my commitment to designing
          inclusive, supportive experiences. By prioritising empathy and
          accessibility, I focused on creating a platform that empowers mentors
          to help DSG youth embrace their identities confidently. While I
          centered much of the design around the mentor’s perspective, I am
          eager to further explore the mentee experience.
          <br />
          Unfortunately, I didn’t have the chance to interview mentees for this
          project, but I recognize the immense value their insights would bring
          to enhancing the platform. In future iterations, I hope to incorporate
          mentee feedback to ensure their unique needs and voices are fully
          represented.
